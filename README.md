Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md`/`.mdx` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/layouts/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact/Json components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
